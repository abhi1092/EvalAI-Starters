<p>"Evaluation metrics: We use three metrics to evaluate agents: Success Rate, Success weighted by Path Length
    (SPL) , and Success weighted by Number of Actions(SNA) .
    The Success Rate is defined as the ratio of the number of times the agent successfully navigates to the target to the
    total number of test trials. A trial is considered successful based on four criteria: first, the agent needs to explicitly ex-
    ecute action found; second, the distance between the agent and the goal is less than 2 meter; third, the target physical object should appear in the agent's view; fourth, the length of the action sequence is less than the maximum number of allowed time steps N. We set N as 200 for all comparisons, as this was twice the average action sequence length of the demonstration data. The SPL is a metric that jointly considers the success rate weighted by the path length to reach the goal from the starting point. And the SNA jointly considers the number of actions and the success rate, by penalizing collisions, rotations, and height adjustments needed to find the objects"</p>
